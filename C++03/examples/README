Note that at

  http://www2.research.att.com/~bs/bs_faq.html#C++03

it is written:

"What is the difference between C++98 and C++03?

 From a programmer's view there is none. The C++03 revision of the standard was
 a bug fix release for implementers to ensure greater consistency and
 portability. In particular, tutorial and reference material describing C++98
 and C++03 can be used interchangeably by all except compiler writers and
 standards gurus.

 Personally, I tend not to use the term "C++03" because it is easily confused
 with "C++0x" and could give the impression that C++98 is outdated."

so most code will be in the C++98 directory.
