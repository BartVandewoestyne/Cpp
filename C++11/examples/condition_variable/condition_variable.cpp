/*
 * Key ideas:
 *
 *   - Condition variables allow us to synchronize threads via notifications.
 *     So, you can implement workflows like sender/receiver or producer/consumer.
 *     In such a workflow, the receiver is waiting for the sender's notification.
 *     If the receiver gets the notification, it continues its work.
 *
 *   - In fact, it can happen that the receiver finished its task before the
 *     sender has sent its notification. How is that possible? The receiver is
 *     susceptible to spurious wakeups. So the receiver wakes up, although no
 *     notification happens. To protect it from this, one has to add a predicate
 *     to the wait method.
