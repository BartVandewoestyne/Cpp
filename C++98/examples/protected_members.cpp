To argue that *protected* members should not be used in C++, you could refer to several key concepts and design principles. Here's a breakdown of C++ resources and reasons that might help you argue against the use of *protected* members:

### 1. **Effective C++ by Scott Meyers (3rd Edition)**
   - **Item 22: "Declare data members private"**  
     Scott Meyers argues that data members should generally be private to maintain strong encapsulation. He emphasizes that *protected* members weaken encapsulation because derived classes can directly manipulate base class internals. This can lead to unintended dependencies between base and derived classes, violating the "open/closed principle."

### 2. **C++ Core Guidelines (by Bjarne Stroustrup and Herb Sutter)**
   - **C.131: Avoid protected data**  
     The C++ Core Guidelines explicitly recommend avoiding protected data members. This guideline emphasizes that protected members are a source of tight coupling between the base and derived classes, making it harder to maintain and extend the code. They also make it difficult to ensure that the internal state of the base class remains consistent when derived classes access or modify it.

### 3. **Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma et al.**
   - **Principle of encapsulation and composition over inheritance**  
     This foundational text emphasizes the importance of encapsulation and often suggests favoring *composition* over *inheritance*. When you use *protected* members, you're directly exposing part of your class’s internal structure, which can lead to tight coupling and reduced flexibility, contradicting the benefits of composition.

### 4. **Modern C++ Design by Andrei Alexandrescu**
   - Alexandrescu is a proponent of modern, template-based C++ design that relies heavily on type safety and encapsulation. His work implies that protected members break encapsulation and violate design principles by allowing access to base class details that should remain private. This undermines maintainability and the robustness of abstractions.

### 5. **SOLID Principles**
   - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
     *Protected* members often violate SRP by letting derived classes have access to too much internal detail of the base class. When the internal implementation of the base class changes, derived classes may need to change as well, violating SRP.
   - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**  
     Derived classes should work without needing to know the internals of the base class. By using *protected* members, derived classes are more likely to violate LSP since they depend on specific base class implementation details.

### 6. **Clean Code by Robert C. Martin**
   - Martin’s book stresses the importance of maintaining clean, modular, and maintainable code. The use of protected members leads to fragile code by exposing the internals of base classes to subclasses, thus creating unwanted dependencies that can complicate maintenance and lead to bugs during refactoring.

### Key Points Against Using Protected Members:
- **Weakens Encapsulation**: The internal state of a class becomes partially visible to derived classes, reducing the benefits of encapsulation.
- **Increased Coupling**: Derived classes become tightly coupled to the base class’s implementation, making future changes more error-prone.
- **Complicates Maintenance**: Changes in the base class can unintentionally affect derived classes, increasing the risk of regression bugs.
- **Limited Flexibility**: Using protected members discourages flexibility and discourages using patterns like composition, which provide better separation of concerns.
