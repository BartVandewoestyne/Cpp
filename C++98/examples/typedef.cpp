/*
 * Useful things to know about typedefs:
 *
 *   1. Typedefs are not typesafe!
 *   2. Typedefs have their place when it comes to defining complex function
 *      arguments.
 *   3. Typedefs are useful in defining data members that must maintain a
 *      constant size across different compilers and computer hardware.
