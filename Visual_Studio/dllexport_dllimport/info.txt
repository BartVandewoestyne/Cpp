Static library
--------------
* Typically has the extension .lib

* Functions and procedures can be placed here and called as the application is being compiled.

* Usually bigger, as it contains all of the code.

* Compile command:

    cl /c /EHsc foobar.cpp
    lib foobar.obj
    cl /EHsc main.cpp /link foobar.lib

Dynamic Link Library
--------------------
* Typically has the extension .dll

* Application can call these libraries during run-time and not during compilation.

* Multiple smaller files.

* Problems:
    - when you change the content of the DLL, this can lead to versioning problems.
