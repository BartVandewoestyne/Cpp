VS2005 does not support MFC or other advanced functions
[...]
Only if the OP really wants MFC. Personally, the only thing I have missed in the Express edition is the profiler. But I can get around that by using better tools like CodeAnalyst (or switch to linux and use gprof). VC++ Express + platform SDK is a development platform capable of producing fully functional and optimized CUDA applications.
