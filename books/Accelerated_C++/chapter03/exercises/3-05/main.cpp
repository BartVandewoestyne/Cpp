/**
 * 3-5. Write a program that will keep track of grades for several students at once. The
 * program could keep two vectors in sync: The first should hold the student's names, and
 * the second the final grades that can be computed as input is read. For now, you should
 * assume a fixed number of homework grades. We'll see in ยง4.1.3/56 how to handle a variable
 * number of grades intermixed with student names.
