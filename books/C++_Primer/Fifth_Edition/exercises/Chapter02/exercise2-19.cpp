/**
 * Reference:
 *
 *   - A reference is not an object in its own right, so doesn't have an
 *     address.  Hence, you may not define a pointer to a reference.
 *
 *   - Needs to be initialized at the time it is defined.
 *
 *   - Once we have defined a reference, there is no way to make that reference
 *     refer to a different object.  When we use a reference, we always get the
 *     object to which the reference was initially bound.
 *
 * Pointer:
 *
 *   - A pointer is an object in its own right and also has an address.
 *
 *   - Pointers can be assigned and copied.
 *
 *   - A single pointer can point to different objects during its lifetime.
 *
 *   - Does not need to be initialized at the time it is defined.
