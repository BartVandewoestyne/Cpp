/*
 * Drawbacks of using an array instead of a vector:
 *
 *   1. Unlike a vector, arrays have fixed size; we cannot add elements to
 *      an array.
 *   2. We cannot initialize an array as a copy of another array, nor is it
 *      legal to assign one array to another.
 *   3. TODO: OTHER DRAWBACKS???
