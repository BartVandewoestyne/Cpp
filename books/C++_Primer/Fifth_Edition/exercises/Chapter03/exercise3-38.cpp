/**
 * Pointers are like numbers that denote positions on a
 * scale of some kind. It makes sense to subtract two such
 * positions to find the interval between them, and it makes
 * sense to add two intervals, or to add a position and an
 * interval. But it doesn't make sense to add two positions;
 * one can only do so by agreeing on a zero reference and then
 * converting one or both positions to intervals.
