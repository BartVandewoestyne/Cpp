// A candidate function is a function with the same name as the called function
// and for which a declaration is visible at the point of the call.
//
// The subset of the candidate functions that can be called with the arguments
// in the given call, ar viable functions.  To be viable, a function must have
// the same number of parameters as there are arguments in the call, and the
// type of each argument must match -- or be convertible to -- the type of its
// corresponding parameter.
