The while condition checks the state of the stream returned from the >>
expression (see page 312).

The code that is executed when we use a stream as a condition is equivalent to
calling !fail().  If !fail() is true, then this means that failbit (IO operation
failed) and badbit (stream is corrupted) are not set.
