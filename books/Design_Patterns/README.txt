This is my implementation of the Design Patterns from the book

  'Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software'
  Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides

The webpage and official 'code' for this book are available from:

The nice thing about the book is that it is... well... not complete :-)
To obtain a complete working implementation of all the Design Patterns
presented requires some extra coding.  The goal of this project is to actually
provide the missing pieces and come to something that will compile and run
cleanly.

On the following websites, I have found some more C++ code that helped me
complete everything:
