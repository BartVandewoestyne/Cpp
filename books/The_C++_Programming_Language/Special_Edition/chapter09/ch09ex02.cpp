/**
 * (*2) Where are the headers for nonstandard' 'foundation" libraries kept?

/*
 * I'm not sure what exactly is meant by 'foundation' library, but I assume
 * it's just nonstandard libraries such as the following:
 *
 *   - Microsoft Foundation Classes
 *   - Enlightenment Foundation Libraries
 *   - ...
 *
 * These are located under
 *
 *   /usr/include
