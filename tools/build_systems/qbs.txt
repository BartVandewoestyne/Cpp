IMPORTANT: Qbs is 'deprecated', see

  http://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/10/29/deprecation-of-qbs/

but this only means that it is no longer maintained by the Qt Company. It might
be maintained by the community in the future:

Apparently, Qbs 1.13 is the latest release by the Qt Company. After that, the
project will be handed over to the community:
